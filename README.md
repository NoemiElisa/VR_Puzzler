# Noemi’s puzzler project
This project is a VR game created with Unity as part of the experience of the VR Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. It is targeted for android, but could be deployed for IOS as well.

## Introduction:
This project is a VR game created with Unity as part of the experience of the VR Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. It is targeted for android, but could be deployed for IOS as well. The goal of this project is to apply the design concepts learned on the 4th course.

**Unique Considerations:**
As you can see on this documentation, there were many unique design considerations on the creation of this project: The structure of the dungeon, the design of the user feedback, the scale, lighting, sound and motion.

**Puzzler game:**
This game it’s a version of Simon Says that takes place in a dungeon. The user is challenged to solve the sequence in which the orbs inside the dungeon are lighted up in order to escape from the same.

## Outcome:
The game was tested with users that were not familiar with VR. However, it seemed intuitive enough for them and they had a good time. 

### Design Process:

**Statement of purpose:**
The purpose of the project is to practice design and user testing for a VR application. The purpose of the application itself is to create a simple VR game to introduce VR to beginners. 

**Sketches:**
Below are some of the sketches that were considered for the creation of this project.

**Persona:**

*Name: * Maria

*Age: * 21

*Role:* Student

*VR Experience:* Little to none

*Quote:* “VR looks interesting and I’d like to give it a go.”

*About this person:* Maria is a university student of biology. She likes games and she is interested in the VR world to maybe apply it in the future in her career.

## Process 
**User test:** 
The game was tested with a user with no experience in VR in order to understand if a beginner could use the game and find it intuitive.

*First user test:*

| Question  | Answer | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| How big or small are you feeling?   | I feel the space is big, but just a little	My intention was to make the dungeon feel big, so this is the expected output  |   |
| Are you comfortable with the ambient and objects?  | Yes  |   |
| What mood is the ambient producing?  | Intriguing, expectation  |  I was expecting a bit more “scary” situation but this is not bad either |
		
*Second user test:*

| Question  | Answer | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| What do you think of the movement and the speed of movement?   | It is good	|   |
| Are you feeling sick or dizzy? | No  |   |
| Do you feel your height have changed now? | No  |  These questions didn’t lead to a lot of elaboration from the user, but it seems there was due to a good design. |

*Third user test:*

| Question  | Answer | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Was it a comfortable experience?  | Yes, it was alright	|   |
| Are the orbs at a good distance between each other? | Yes, they are good. A bit dizzy to click them | The user had difficulties advancing the game. The user keeps moving the head while the orbs are playing instead of waiting to see the secuence before starting moving |
| Is the game intuitive and easy to understand? | Yes  |   |
| Can you read the board fine? | Well, it’s a bit blurry as I cannot wear my glasses but the size is good  | User wears glasses and that makes it hard to enjoy the VR experience. Also, the UI screen says to click on the orb, and this is not quite clear to the user as it is in 2D. |

**Outcome of the user test:** 

I should consider moving the orbs as in the example, but I am sticking to my original design as it is a bit more challenging this way. 

I should consider testing this game with more users to get a better average idea, although I found it interesting that the test user enjoyed the game even without glasses and this makes me think of the future of VR. 

I changed the UI screen to click on the button rather than click on the orb as this naming seemed confussing in 2D.

It is hard to keep all users happy.

**Breakdown of final app:**
At the start of the game there is a UI screen welcoming the users and inviting them to start the game. In the background, there is a sound of crickets that set the mood into a nocturnal environment.

After clicking in the round button, the user is moved inside the dungeon where the orbs start lighting up in a sequence. The music changes to an intriguing sound. The user can then select the orbs.

If a mistake is made, there is a failing sound to provide the user the feedback that there was a mistake and the sequence starts again.

If the sequence is correct, the user is transported outside the dungeon and another sound is played to indicate success. In here there is a UI screen inviting the user to play again.

## Conclusion
This project was hard to do because it involved other people rather than just the developer. However, thanks to that, one can see the potential issues and create a better quality game.

The game itself ended up being a great way of introducing a new person into VR.

**Next steps:**

1. Investigate with more users would be the first next step.
2. It would be interesting to have different levels. Maybe adding orbs when successful.
3. Another idea could be to connect the different projects.
4. I think the background of the game could be a bit nicer than it is.
